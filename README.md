# Random Name Generator
This random name generator creates a name by randomly combining individual or combinations of letters. The resulting names are not your ordinary Richard or John - with multiple runs, you'll discover combinations that mankind would never thought of under normal circumstances.
Perfect for those who are bad at naming things but would like to write silly stories full of inside jokes and parody of real life friends and relatives as a birthday present (if you're that special kind of friend).
